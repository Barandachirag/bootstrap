  In Bootstrap 4, as well as in many other modern CSS frameworks, Flexbox refers to the Flexible Box Layout module, which is a layout model provided by CSS3. Flexbox allows you to create complex layouts more easily and efficiently than traditional CSS approaches.

  Flexbox introduces a set of properties and values that enable flexible and dynamic positioning and alignment of elements within a container. Some key concepts of Flexbox include:

  1.Flex Container: The parent element containing one or more flex items is known as the flex container. To create a flex container, you apply display: flex; or display: inline-flex; to the container element.

  2.Flex Items: The children of a flex container are referred to as flex items. These items can be laid out horizontally or vertically, reordered, and aligned within the flex container.

  3.Main Axis and Cross Axis: Flexbox operates along two axes: the main axis and the cross axis. The main axis is defined by the flex-direction property, and items are laid out along this axis. The cross axis is perpendicular to the main axis.

  4.Flex Direction: The flex-direction property determines the direction in which flex items are laid out within the flex container. It can be set to row (horizontal), column (vertical), row-reverse, or column-reverse.

  5.Justify Content: The justify-content property controls the alignment of flex items along the main axis of the flex container. It allows you to distribute extra space among flex items or adjust their positioning.

  6.Align Items and Align Self: The align-items property aligns flex items along the cross axis of the flex container. The align-self property allows individual flex items to override the align-items value and align themselves differently.

  7.Flex Wrap: By default, flex items are laid out in a single line. The flex-wrap property allows you to control whether flex items should wrap onto multiple lines or stay on a single line.

  8.Flex Grow, Shrink, and Basis: Flex items can grow and shrink to fill available space using the flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis properties.

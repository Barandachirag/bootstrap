    <!-- What do you know about the Bootstrap Grid System? -->
</head>
<body>
   1. Container: The grid system in Bootstrap begins with a container. It provides a fixed-width container to house the site's content. Bootstrap offers two types of containers: .container for a responsive fixed-width container and .container-fluid for a full-width container spanning the entire viewport width.

   2.Rows: Inside the container, you use rows to organize and align content horizontally. Rows are horizontal groups of columns.

   3.Columns: Columns are the basic building blocks of the Bootstrap grid system. You can create columns within rows to lay out your content. Bootstrap uses a 12-column grid system, allowing you to divide your layout into 12 equal-width columns. You can specify the width of each column using classes such as .col for equal-width columns or .col-{breakpoint}-{number} for responsive columns that adjust their width based on the screen size.

   3.Responsive Design: Bootstrap's grid system is inherently responsive, meaning it automatically adjusts the layout and column widths based on the screen size or device. You can use responsive classes to control the layout behavior at different breakpoints (e.g., extra small, small, medium, large, and extra-large screens).

   4.Offsetting Columns: Bootstrap allows you to offset columns within a row using offset classes. This lets you create gaps between columns or shift them horizontally.

   5.Nesting Grids: You can nest rows and columns within each other to create more complex layouts. This allows for greater flexibility in organizing content.

   6.Alignment and Ordering: Bootstrap provides classes for aligning content vertically and horizontally within columns, as well as for changing the order of columns at different breakpoints.

   7.Utility Classes: Bootstrap offers a range of utility classes to control the grid system, including classes for hiding and showing content at specific breakpoints, adjusting column spacing, and more.

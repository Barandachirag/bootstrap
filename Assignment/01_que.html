    <!-- What are the advantages of Bootstrap? -->
    Ans:
    1. Responsive Design: Bootstrap provides a responsive grid system and predefined classes for   creating     responsive layouts that adapt to various screen sizes. This ensures that your website looks good and functions well on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices without the need for extensive custom CSS.

    2. Consistency: Bootstrap comes with a set of pre-designed components, such as buttons, forms, navigation bars, and typography styles. Using these components ensures consistency across your website, making it easier to maintain and providing a unified user experience.

    3. Customizable: While Bootstrap offers ready-made components, it's also highly customizable. Developers can easily modify the default styles, colors, and components to match the design requirements of their project. This flexibility allows for creativity while still benefiting from the framework's structure and functionality.

    4. Cross-browser Compatibility: Bootstrap is designed to be compatible with all major browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Internet Explorer. It saves developers time by handling many cross-browser compatibility issues, ensuring that the website looks and works consistently across different browsers.

    5. Community Support: Bootstrap has a large and active community of developers who contribute plugins, themes, and extensions to extend its functionality. This community support means that developers can find solutions to common problems, access resources, and share knowledge with others using Bootstrap.

    6. Documentation and Resources: Bootstrap offers comprehensive documentation, including examples, tutorials, and guidelines for using its features effectively. This documentation makes it easier for developers to learn Bootstrap and leverage its capabilities in their projects. Additionally, there are numerous online resources, forums, and tutorials available for further assistance.

    7. Faster Development: By using Bootstrap's predefined components and responsive grid system, developers can build websites more quickly compared to starting from scratch. Bootstrap streamlines the development process by providing a solid foundation and reducing the need for repetitive coding tasks.

    8. Accessibility: Bootstrap follows best practices for accessibility, making it easier for developers to create websites that are usable by people with disabilities. The framework includes features such as keyboard navigation support, ARIA roles, and semantic HTML markup, which contribute to a more accessible user experience.

<body>
    Bootstrap 5, released in 2020, introduced several changes and improvements over Bootstrap 4. Here's a summary of the key differences between Bootstrap 4 and Bootstrap 5:

    1.jQuery Dependency: Bootstrap 4 relies on jQuery for its JavaScript plugins and components, while Bootstrap 5 has removed this dependency. Bootstrap 5's JavaScript components are built with Vanilla JavaScript and can be used without jQuery.

    2.Customization Options: Bootstrap 5 offers enhanced customization options compared to Bootstrap 4. It provides more Sass variables, enabling developers to customize various aspects of the framework, such as colors, typography, spacing, and breakpoints, to better fit their project's needs.

    3.New Components: Bootstrap 5 introduces several new components and utilities, including accordion, off-canvas sidebar, improved form controls, list groups with badges, and more. It also enhances existing components like the navbar, carousel, and modal.

    4.Dropped IE Support: Bootstrap 5 dropped support for Internet Explorer (IE) 10 and 11. This allows for cleaner and more modern code without needing to accommodate legacy browser compatibility.

    5.Optimized Grid System: Bootstrap 5 optimizes its grid system for better performance and flexibility. It introduces a new grid tier (xxl) for extra-large screens, improves the spacing between columns, and enhances the layout options for responsive design.

    6.Updated Documentation and Examples: Bootstrap 5 features updated documentation with improved navigation and examples. The documentation provides clearer explanations and better organization of content, making it easier for developers to find what they need.

    7.Utility API: Bootstrap 5 introduces a new utility API that allows developers to quickly apply utility classes for common CSS properties like margin, padding, text alignment, and more. This API streamlines the development process and reduces the need for custom CSS.

    8.Improved Accessibility: Bootstrap 5 places a stronger emphasis on accessibility by improving keyboard navigation, focus states, and semantic HTML. This ensures that websites and applications built with Bootstrap are more accessible to users with disabilities.

<!-- What are the default Bootstrap text settings? -->

<body>
    In Bootstrap, text elements have default styling applied to them. Here are some of the default text settings in Bootstrap:

   1. Font Family: Bootstrap uses the system's default sans-serif font stack for text elements. This typically includes fonts like Arial, Helvetica, and sans-serif.
    
   2. Font Size: The default font size for the body element is 16 pixels (1rem), and other text elements inherit or are set relative to this size.
    
   3. Line Height: Bootstrap sets a line-height of 1.5 for most text elements to improve readability and spacing.
    
   4. Font Weight: By default, Bootstrap uses font-weight: normal; for most text elements, which corresponds to a regular (400) font weight.
    
   5. Text Color: The default text color is usually black (#000) for regular text on a light background and white (#fff) for text on dark backgrounds.
    
   6. Text Alignment: Text is typically aligned to the left by default, while some components may have centered or right-aligned text as needed.
    
   7.Text Decoration: Text decorations like underline are not applied by default, but Bootstrap provides classes to add or remove these decorations (text-decoration-none for removing underlines, for example).
